> The project is based on a find your house app. But this is inspired with the current shift in the global scale- to finding a tutor. It has capability for users to create tutors, add to favourites and has been built with a test driven approach. Currently the user can:

1. Log in the app,authenticated by devise
2. The user is presented with a list of tutors they either created or created by other users.
3. When a user selects a tutor, detailed information about the tutor is presented and the possibility add the tutor to favourites
4. The user can access a list of favourite tutors
